Project Title:
Barcode and QR code scanner 

Summary:
The objective of the project is to implement a barcode scanner and QR code. This is achieved with the following technologies and libraries: Python version 3.XX, OpenCV, QT, and ZBar.


The reason for this project is the huge need to facilitate the current methods of scanning and paying for the products we buy every day. How many times have I not been in huge queues? How many hours have we lost in recent years, instead of doing something productive? The answer is many times and many hours wasted unnecessarily. From here we came up with the idea that we could make a simple application that read in the first phase the bar codes and QR codes.

Getting Started:
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


Prerequisites and Installing:
To run my sample you need to install the following ->
-> Python v3.6.4 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/
Just download the executable and run it if you use windows 7+
->Install OpenCV v3.4.1 from https://opencv.org/opencv-3-4-1.html
Download the executable if you are running Windows 7+
After the installation, you need to make the OpenCV compatible with python v3.6.4.
You will need to pip install some Wheel files to make OpenCV compatible with python v3.X.X,
so watch this tutorial:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izN-NLpS5t8
->Install what python ide you like
->Install PyQT5:  https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/
->Install PyZbar: https://pypi.org/project/pyzbar/
